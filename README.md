# SignalR Sample ASP.NET Core 9.0 to Vue

![.NET Core](https://github.com/Seekatar/signalr/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)
![Vue CI](https://github.com/Seekatar/signalr/workflows/Vue%20CI/badge.svg)

This is a sample project that uses a .NET Core ASP.NET server that uses SignalR to send messages to a VueJs client.

I started with older sample code from [here](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/aspnet-core/1480/aspnet-core-vuejs-signalr-app). I updated it in December 2024 to .NET 9 and VueJs 3.

## Running the Apps

Running the server in the VSCode debugger will start it with https on port 5000. You can then test it as below.

To run the client app, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd vue/client
npm install # only needed the first time
npm run dev
```

That will launch the UI for simple testing of SignalR. You can send a message, and it will be displayed in the UI. For more extensive testing of JWT, users and groups, see the next section.

## Testing the Server

The [server/server.http](server/server.http) has calls to the server to test the SignalR hub.

- /message/jwt - gets a JWT for the SignalR client to use
- /message - sends a message to all SignalR clients
- /message/sent-to - sends a message to one SignalR client, or if `@` is prefixed, it will send to clients in that group

Using my [SignalRLogger](https://github.com/MrSeekatar/SignalRLogger) as a client you can connect with a JWT generated by /message/jwt as different users and groups.

## GitHub Actions

This uses GitHub Actions to build the apps
