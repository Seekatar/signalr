# SignalR Sample ASP.NET Core 9.0 to Vue

> âš  Note the Vue code is stale and hasn't been updated. Using my [SignalRLogger](https://github.com/MrSeekatar/SignalRLogger) as a client works with the current server code.

Sample project that uses a .NET Core ASP.NET project for a server that uses SignalR to send messages to a VueJs client.

Started with older sample code from [here](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/aspnet-core/1480/aspnet-core-vuejs-signalr-app). Updated in December 2024 to .NET 9.

## Testing the Server

The [server/server.http](server/server.http) has calls to the server to test the SignalR hub.

- /message/jwt - gets a JWT for the SignalR client to use
- /message - sends a message to all SignalR clients
- /message/sent-to - sends a message to one SignalR client, or if `@` is prefixed, it will send to clients in that group
